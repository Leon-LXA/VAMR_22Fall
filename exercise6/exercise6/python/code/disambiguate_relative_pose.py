    """ DISAMBIGUATERELATIVEPOSE- finds the correct relative camera pose (among
     four possible configurations) by returning the one that yields points
     lying in front of the image plane (with positive depth).

     Arguments:
       Rots -  3x3x2: the two possible rotations returned by decomposeEssentialMatrix
       u3   -  a 3x1 vector with the translation information returned by decomposeEssentialMatrix
       p1   -  3xN homogeneous coordinates of point correspondences in image 1
       p2   -  3xN homogeneous coordinates of point correspondences in image 2
       K1   -  3x3 calibration matrix for camera 1
       K2   -  3x3 calibration matrix for camera 2

     Returns:
       R -  3x3 the correct rotation matrix
       T -  3x1 the correct translation vector

       where [R|t] = T_C2_C1 = T_C2_W is a transformation that maps points
       from the world coordinate system (identical to the coordinate system of camera 1)
       to camera 2.

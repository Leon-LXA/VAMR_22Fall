function [dx, ssds] = trackBruteForce(I_R, I, x_T, r_T, r_D)
% I_R: reference image, I: image to track point in, x_T: point to track,
% expressed as [x y]=[col row], r_T: radius of patch to track, r_D: radius
% of patch to search dx within; dx: translation that best explains where
% x_T is in image I, ssds: SSDs for all values of dx within the patch
% defined by center x_T and radius r_D.
